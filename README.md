# Drum Your Memory

Drum Your Memory is a vanilla JavaScript game which both allows you to freely play the drums using keyboard keys and play a memory game.

## Memory Game
The way the memory game works is the computer will randomly select x number of drum sounds and play them. When the computer has stopped playing
you will be prompted to play back the sounds you heard in the exact order you heard them in. When the computer plays the sound it will also highlight
the key on your screen, giving you a visual representation of which sound is being played.
